# Accident detector - IOT project

## Description
The vehicles face problems like the collision in the parking lot, traffic jams etc especially in the metro cities like Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi. So in order to avoid such minor accidents we make use of the sensors like IR infrared proximity sensor and a buzzer. The sensor is used to find the nearness of the vehicle, and the buzzer starts beeping when the vehicle is in the particular range that can cause an accident. If we are using an analog sensor then we are able to find the exact distance of the other vehicle from the particular vehicle, and the buzzer beeps with the different frequency when it is at different distances i.e. when the vehicle is very near to the other vehicle it beeps with the maximum frequency, and when it is at a distance that is far but within the range of the IR sensor it beeps with the lesser frequency. So this can be made as a mandatory device in the vehicles in order to avoid the collision. Sometimes the collision takes place in the traffic and they try to escape from the judiciary, this can be avoided by the implementing of this device in the vehicles and including the GPS modem along with it. By this we can get the location where the crime has taken place. The data that has been created by the sensor is uploaded on to the thingspeak platform and from there the details can be tweeted to the social sites.
